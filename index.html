                <p><em>Studying HND in Computing at <strong>UKCBC</strong></em></p>
                
                <p>I have been studying computing at UKCBC for nearly seven months. I love computers, music, reading books and playing video games. I want to become professional in the IT field because I have always been fascinated about computers and therefore this is what I want to do in the future. 
                So far, I have done four modules: Programming, Networking, Database Development and Professional Practice. The modules I am currently doing are Web Development and Security. 
                I love this course because I learn new things every week and feel that I am developing new skills rapidly. </p></td>
